In the second part of FRM exam, the content is divided into four main
 categories of risk: market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity
  risk. In this post, I am going to organize and structure the knowledge with
   regard to Value at Risk, in the Market Risk part.
   
##Value at Risk (VaR)

```math
Normal VaR = VaR(\alpha)
```

$$ p(\theta|X) = \frac{p(X|\theta) p(\theta)}{p(X)} $$
