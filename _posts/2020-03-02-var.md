VaR Mapping refers to the process of replacing the current value of a portfolio with risk factor
 exposures. Generally, it is the process of replacing each instrument by its exposures on
  selected risk factors. Through mapping, a complex portfolio or instrument can be broken down
   into its constituent elements that determine its value.

### Mapping process
- mark all positions to market value
- identify common risk factors for different investment positions
- allocate the market value for each position/instrument to the risk factors
- construct a risk factor distribution and put all data into risk model

### General and Specific Risks Captures
To demonstrate how the choice and number of general risk factors affect the
 size of specific risks, consider a portfolio of bonds with different
  maturities, ratings, terms, and different denominations.
  
Assume a portfolio has N stocks and map each stock to the market index, which
 we define as the primitive risk factor.
 
The risk exposure, $$beta_{i}$$, is computed by regressing the return of
 stock i on the market index return using:
 
 $$R_{i} = \propto_{i} + \beta_{i} R_{M} + \epsilon_{i}$$
