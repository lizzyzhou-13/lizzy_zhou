Term structure models are employed to predict the evolution of short interest
 rates. In this topic I delve into different term structure models according
  to the feature - drift.


### Normal Distribution Without Drift (Model 1)

The simplest model is Model 1, is used in cases where there is no drift and
 interest rates are normally distributed. Under this model, the continuously
  compounded, instantaneous rate $$r_{t}$$ is assumed to evolve according to
   the following equation:

$$ dr = \sigma dw $$

#### Example
Suppose the current value of the short-term rate is 5.26%, that volatility
 equals 115 bp per year, the time interval under consideration is 1/12 year
 . Determine the short-term rate after one month.

The change in the short-term rate is given by:

The random variable dw, with zero mean and $$ \sigma $$ of $$\sqrt{\frac{1
}{12}}$$ or 0.2887, takes on a value of 0.25.

$$ dr = \sigma dw 
       = 1.15% * 0.25 = 0.2875% $$

Therefore, the new short-term rate = 5.26% + 0.2875% = 5.55%

Interest Rate Tree model wihout Drift can be demonstrated as:

### Normal Distribution With Drift (Model 2)

In practice, the term structure of interest rates takes on an upward sloping
 yield curve. That varies with Model 1 which assumes no drift. Model 2 adds a
  positive drift term which is essentially a positive risk premium associated
   with longer time horizons. Under this model, the continuously compounded
   , instantaneous rate rt is assumed to evolve according to the following
    equation:
    
   $$ dr = \lambda dt + \sigma dw $$

where $$\lamda$$ is the drift.

Interest Rate Tree model with Drift can be demonstrated as:

Note that the interest rate tree for Model 2 looks similar to Model 1 but the
 drift term $$\lambda dt $$ is added, which increases by $$\lamda dt $$ in the
  next period, 2 $$\lambda dt $$ in the second period, and 3 $$\lamda dt $$ in
   the third period, and so on.
   
Model 2 is more effective than Model 1. Intuitively, the drift term
 accommodates the typically observed upward-sloping nature of the term
  structure.

The drift can be interpreted as a combination of true drift and risk premium
 but this only makes practical sense in the short term. In the long-term, it
  is difficult to make a case for rising expected rates.

### Short-Term Rate Tree under the Ho-Lee Model

Ho-Lee model was introduced by Thomas Ho and Sang Bin Lee in 1986. It is
 similar to Model 2, but with a difference: While Model 2 assumes that the
  drift ($$\lambda$$) is constant from step to step along the tree, the Ho
  -Lee Model assumes that drift changes over time.

The dynamics of the risk-neutral process in the Ho-Lee model are given by:

$$dr = \lambda_{t} dt+ \sigma dw $$

A drift that varies with time is called a time-dependent drift. The time
-dependent drift over each time period represents some combination of the
 risk premium and of expected changes in the short-term rate.

The Ho-Lee model can be demonstrated as:

$$ \lambda_{1}$$ and $$ \lambda_{2}$$ are estimated from observed market
 prices. Drift for the first period is the observed spot interest rate. Drift
  for the second period is estimated from the market price of two-period
   securities and the first-period drift.
   

### Arbitrage-free and Equilibrium Models

The key issue in choosing between the two types is the desirability of
 fitting hte model to match market prices. The choice depends on the purpose
  of the model.

Arbitrage-free short-rate models: 
1.To generate the true stochastic interest rate
 generating process by using real market data. They are suitable for quoting
  the prices of securities that do not have an active market traded based on
   the prices of more liquid securities.
   

2.To value and hedge derivative securities for the purpose of making markets
 or for proprietary trading. E.g. the observable price of a bond can be used
  to price an option on the bond.

Equilibrium short-rate models:
1.Based on laws of economics such as supply-demand and require knowledge of
 investor preferences and probabilities. They make assumptions about the true
  interest rate generating process to determin the correct theoretical term
   structure. 
2.They are suitable for relative analysis (comparing the value of
    two securities) particularly because they do not require the constraint
     that the underlying securities are priced accurately. However, arbitrage
     -free models assume that both securities are properly priced.


### Vasicek Model

Vasicek Model introduces mean reversion into the rate model, which is based
 on the premise that short-term interest rates exhibit mean reversion and
  that there's some sort of a long-term equilibrium:

- when rate < long-run equilibrium value, drift > 0, driving the rate up
 toward a long-run value.
- when rate > long-run equilibrium value, drift < 0, driving the rate down to
 the equilibrium value.

The Vasicek model is given by:

$$dr = k(\theta - r)dt + \sigma dw $$

where:

k = a parameter that measures the speed of reversion adjustment
$$\theta$$ = long-run value of the short-term rate assuming risk neutrality
r = current interest rate level

Under the assumption of risk-neutrality, the long-run value of the short-term
 rate can be approximated as:

$$\theta \approx r_{l} + \frac{\lambda}{k}

where $$r_{l}$$ is the long-run true rate of interest.
