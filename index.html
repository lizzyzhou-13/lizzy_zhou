Hi there! My name is Lizzy.

    On this website you will find my learning notes on financial related topics. Especially those interesting
and important theories applied in risk management, for the reason that I am presently preparing Financial Risk
Manager (FRM) exam by myself. I will also use Python to make practice with data set. Beyond that, I also
try some other interesting topics. Check out my latest update on "What is my survival rate on
Titanic?".



    Thanks for visiting!
