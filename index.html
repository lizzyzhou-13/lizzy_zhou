Hi there! My name is Lizzy.

On this website I am going to document my learning process of using Python for finance related topics. For instance,
forecasting the stock price, visualizing strategy metrics, Scikit learn Machine Learning for investing decisions, etc.
Each project will be organized through Jupyter Notebook, and then a markdown file is presented as a post on this
website.

What's more, I am a fanantic student of [MIT open course](https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT), and
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/ provided online. Therefore from time to time I will be recording my
"lecture notes" from those interesting lectures and store them on this website as well.

Thanks for visiting!
