Hi there! My name is Lizzy.

On this website I am going to document my learning process of using Python for finance related topics. For instance,
forecasting the stock price, visualizing strategy metrics, Scikit learn Machine Learning for investing decisions, etc.
Each project will be organized through Jupyter Notebook, and then a markdown file is presented as a post on this
website. Beyond the financial topics, I also apply python to some other interesting topics. Check out my latest
update on "What is my survival rate on Titanic?".

What's more, I am a fanantic student of MIT Open Course and Coursera provided online. Therefore from time to time I
will be recording my "lecture notes" from those interesting lectures and store them on this website as well.

Thanks for visiting!
