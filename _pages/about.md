I studied Engineering Management & Real Estate at Undergraduate school in
 China, and Construction Management & Engineering at Graduate school in the
  Netherlands (TUDelft). Presently I am working as a Building Information
   Modeling Engineer at a Civil Engineering company based in the Netherlands. 
   
Beside my professional, I love photography, hiking, skiing, gaming, etc. You
